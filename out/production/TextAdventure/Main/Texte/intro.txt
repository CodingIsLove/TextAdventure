Not so long ago there was a university of applied Science called FFHS. And like all universities there are those
nasty exams at the end of each semester. But this semester something strange happend. After all
the students luckily passed this stressful time some of them wanted to know how how they reached the
given mark. Suprisingly the office of the FFHS denied to see the test results. It would seem so that
something was wrong...
really really wrong.

How did we get those marks? Why won't the office give us the results? Why are they not answering our
questions? There was only one student who seemd to be smart enough to solve this riddle!

So its your turn to find what out what happend to our exams.
Will you heroic find the exams or will you give up, because of the bureaucracy ?
You are the last hope for

Get your marks or die tryin!!!!
